<h1>Best animes according to me</h1>

<h2>My top anime of all time</h2>
<h3>Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
<p>This anime was the anime that made me emotionally connect to it. I just have no words to describe this. It's underrated though. Many people say it is not that good. well mehh</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>This was the most engaging one, it was long and i watched it all during my exam time lol.</p>
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>
    This was my first anime that i watched after one netflix ad on the yt channel of triggered insaan.
